# Web Development Basics

After finishing Dev Bootcamp and starting my first tech job, several friends have asked me for advice on beginning their web development journey, so I put together this readme for them.

Most of these resources were acquiered at the code study group that I attend at my company, Optoro. Some also came from Dev Bootcamp, where I spent a good chunk of time learning to program -- this does not include everything I've learned, but I think this is a good foundation.

If you think anything on this guide could be improved or should be changed, just make a pull request and/or email me at gabezurita@gmail.com.

Programming, like anything else, can be broken down into simple steps and learned by most anyone.

Prior to beginning, it’s important to be aware of resources to help get you unstuck or to learn more:

* Getting yourself unstuck:

    * As you're progressing through these tutorials, you will at times find yourself unable to proceed without outside help. This happens to everyone. After being stuck for more than 10 minutes or three unsuccessful attempts, search Google for the specific error message or problem you’re attempting to solve. To do this effectively, here's a few [Google search tips](https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/3yis0k/lpt_how_to_get_the_most_out_of_googlesearch/).

    * Really try to understand why the found solution works and do not move on until you do. **If you can’t understand the problem and/or its solution, get ahold of a friend who might!**
    
    
* Typing code is an important aspect of learning to program. Do not copy/paste solutions you find on the internet, be sure to type them out.

* [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) - Search the error message you’re getting + stackoverflow on a google search. If there are no posts around your error message, feel free to ask for help on a new post. [Here's some guidelines on how ask for help on Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask).

* Don’t be afraid to reference (or even simply explore) the [documentation](http://devdocs.io/ruby~2.4/) of the language you’re studying!

* [Time Management - Pomodoro Timer](https://cirillocompany.de/pages/pomodoro-technique) - Generally speaking, it’s easy to get distracted or to spend one’s time inefficiently -- using the Pomodoro Technique will help you get more done. Here’s a useful [Pomodoro Cheatsheet](http://i.imgur.com/zB4YdEi.png)

* Podcasts are a great way to get introduced to various tech topics. [Codenewbie](https://www.codenewbie.org/podcast) is a good one.

* Get a text editor to edit code --  [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/2) or [Atom](https://atom.io/) will do.

Here’s some resources to explore, and languages to learn in sequential order:

1. Web Basics

2. [HTML](http://devdocs.io/html/) & [CSS](http://devdocs.io/css/) -- HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) are two of the core technologies of hte web and for building Web pages. HTML provides the structure of the page, CSS the (visual and aural) layout, for a variety of devices.
